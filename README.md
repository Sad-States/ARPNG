# Audaxia's Roleplay Name Generator 
_Made by Sad-States_

###FAQ


**What is the difference between ARPNG One and Two?**

> Audaxia's Roleplay Name Generator I is currently hosted on the Audaxian Regional Forums for beta testing of the program and was never meant to be released, until it was on accident on the IRC chat. Audaxia Roleplay Name Generator II will still be hosted on the forums, but it will not need the forum's styling any longer.


**When will it be released?**

> ARPNG I was discontinued and ARPNG II has already been released.


**What language does it use?**

> The generator itself uses Javascript.


**I have name requests!**

> E-Mail me them with the E-Mail Subject stating something like "Add this/these name(s) please, telegram me them on [NationStates](www.nationstates.net) to my main nation [Sad-States](www.nationstates.net/nation=Sad-States), or tell me in a PM on the [#Audaxia Regional IRC.](http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=&channels=Audaxia), my username is usually _Sad-States, Saddy, SS, or Sad. **If my username is Sad-Staway, I am not at the computer.**_
